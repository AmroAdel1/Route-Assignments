## ✨ Features

### 🏠 Home Page
A landing page that introduces the blog and highlights its best content, including:
- Hero section with a clear value proposition
- Featured / most popular posts
- Quick access to categories and calls-to-action driving readers into the blog

### 📰 Blogs Page
The main content hub, with a fully interactive browsing experience:
- **Live search** — filters results as you type (activates only after 3+ characters to avoid noisy partial matches)
- **Category filtering** — filter posts by category, synced to the URL (`/blog?category=Portrait`) so filtered views are shareable and bookmarkable
- **Grid & List views** — toggle between a card grid and a detailed list layout
- **Pagination** — 6 posts per page, with dynamic page controls that adjust to the current result count
- **Empty & error states** — friendly "no articles found" messaging with a one-click "Reset Filters" action
- **Smooth scroll-to-top** on page navigation

### 📖 Blog Details Page
A beautifully styled reading experience for individual articles:
- Full-bleed hero image with breadcrumb navigation and category badge
- Auto-generated **table of contents** parsed directly from the article body
- Clean typographic content sections with icon-accented headings
- Author bio card, tags, and social sharing actions
- **Related articles** — automatically surfaced from the same category

### 👥 About Us Page
Introduces the team behind the blog:
- Mission statement and key stats (readers, articles, writers, categories)
- Core values section
- **Writers showcase** — dynamically rendered from post author data

### 📄 Privacy & Terms Pages
Standard legal pages for transparency and compliance.

### 🚫 Not Found (404) Page
A custom fallback for any unmatched route, keeping navigation consistent with the rest of the site.
